Overall structure:
   * Proposal

   * Intro
   * Background
      Shouldn't describe in terms of my solution
      Should give sufficient basis for evaluation of my success
      
   * Application and Reflection
      Guidence is to seperate into two parts (see 21&22 in folder)
            
   * Conclusion - should mirror intro
   * Bibliography
   * Appendix
      Likely will just be skimmed 

Style/Patterns:
   * Keep separate parts separate. Don't merge into one piece with arbitary headings.
   * 
   * Table of figures, refer to from text
   * Write as 'we'
   
   
   
Other notes:
   * prefer smaller scope over larger
   * Advice is to use sub-sections sparingly. Flowing piece of work.
   * Asked to avoid footnotes
