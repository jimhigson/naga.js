# JSTD config for Naga
#
# Use --basePath when running the tests to make relative to the dissertation project,
# jstestdriver doesn't support looking up directories (as in ../main/*.js) from the
# config files.
#
#  Eg, on my personal laptop I use --basePath ~/dissertation


# We need to be able to load naga's uncompiled source using require from within the tests  
serve: 
 - naga/src/*.js


# Require.js is needed to load code dependencies:
load:
 - naga/src/lib/require.js
 - naga/test/utils/loadRequireDependenciesDuringJstdTest.js
 


# The code under test:
# We do not need to bring in the code under test, require.js
# will load the code that the tests depend on
#  - naga/main/curry.js
#  - naga/main/*.js

# Bring in Bell for the testing suite:
#  - bell/main/*.js

# the test cases to run:
test:
# - naga/test/cases/prefix1Test.js
  - naga/test/cases/testLoadingDependencies.js
# - naga/test/cases/*.js
# - naga/test/cases/simpleTest.js
